                    <p>Hello I am Steven Drain, I am a third year Games, Interactive Media and Mobile (GIMM) student at
                    <b><a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/">Boise State University</a></b>. I am from Eagle Idaho
                    who wants to explore jobs in both programming games and 3D
                    modeling. I learned how to program in middle school with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I learned Unity 3D
                    and C# in Junior Year of High School creating a 3D shooter game which skyrocketed my interest in the
                    games industry. I joined GIMM and continued my education in programming, graphic design, 3D modeling,
                    and Game Design. I have learned how to use <b>Photoshop, Premire, Blender, Unity, Visual Studio Code,
                    and Github</b>. I hope to continue to design games and make expereinces that inspired me to make 
                    unique expereinces. I am currently looking for internships and jobs in the games industry and am excited to see where my career takes me.
                    Below are a few examples of my work. <b>Make sure to click on the images to expand for a

                            This project was created for my web design class. It displays data from a bowling
                            group that my friends
                            and I started. We collected around 90 data points across 15 columns. The
                            technologies I used include
                            <b>HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and D3.js</b>. I utilized D3.js to create the graphs
                            depicted in the first
                            image, and JavaScript in conjunction with <b>Bootstrap</b> to construct the table.
                            The server was built
                            using Express. This class provided me with the opportunity to learn and apply all of
                            these languages,
                            culminating in this project. I am particularly proud of this work because it allowed
                            me to engage deeply
                            with a project that genuinely interested me. I was able to work with data that my
                            friends and I had
                            collected over a year.

                            This project was created for my web design class. It displays data that anyone can add to a
                            fliter table,
                            using <b>JavaScript, HTML, SQL, and More</b>. The website has a total of 4 pages, the index
                            page, the add page, the edit page, and delete page,
                            thet all work together in order to edit the main table on the main page. this table has over
                            500 lines of data that can be filtered by the user by Name,
                            Genre, if it the data is a recipe or a video game, the rating and the ammount of results
                            shown. I am proud of this project because it was the first time I worked with SQL and
                            made something of this scale, this project took a lot of time and relearning in order to
                            make this project work. I am particularly proud of the CSS work and the JavaScript, as
                            I had to make systems I've never worked with before and made a CSS file that I am extremely
                            happy with I love the retro feel of windows 95 and used it heavily as inspiration. This
                            project was a culmination of all the skills I learned in the class and <b>countless of
                            hours</b> of work that I am proud of. if you want to see the code for this project you can

                            This was the first Game I ever made in High School, it helped me learn what I wanted
                            to do in life,
                            it taught me basics in<b> Programming (C#), 3D modeling, Graphic Design, and Game
                                Design</b>,
                            while I don't have my code with me anymore you can still download my project from
                            the <b><a href="https://kronosgamedev.itch.io/project-olympus">Project Olympus
                                    Itch.io Page</a></b>. I worked with
                            another student on this game and we took around two years to make this game. I'm
                            proud of what we have
                            made even if it is pretty lackluster. I had the most fun and am the most proud of
                            the 3d models I made
                            which you can see a bit more in this <a

                            This project was the first VR Game I worked on, this was a group project that I
                            collaborated with four other people on. This project was to teach someone how to use gym equipment and help
                            the user get acclimated in the gym space. We initially did not want to do a gym equipment tutorial,
                            but a campus tour where the user would be able to click on the buildings on our campus and would be able to see important
                            locations and information about the buildings. We had to pivot pretty deep into our idea phase, due to many different problems
                            We worked on the idea for a semester and got used to using the equipment: <b>Unity for VR, Occulus Quest 2 and 3, and 360 
                            cameras</b>. I worked mostly on the <b>script for the videos we took, scheduling times for filming, coming up with the initial idea, filming the
                             360 videos, 360 Video editing in Premire Pro, and minor Unity programming.</b> I learned a lot about video editing
                             and the complexities of working with a team on a project.

                                This is an endless shooter that is set in a western enviroment, the object of
                                the game is to shoot as many enemies as possible
                                before they touch you. I had 10 days to make this game and I am proud of what I
                                made, while the idea is really simple and there are a lot of bugs that make it tough 
                                to play for a long time and very basic and rudementary ways to do the power-up which I have 
                                now learned much easier and simpler ways of making. if you want to check it out <b>the link to download is here:

                                This was one of the <b>first collabroative game projects I worked on in GIMM</b>, I
                                worked with four others in creating this interactive comic,
                                we were given the topic, <b>Consiousness, death, and the implications of quantum
                                    mechanics </b>, I worked specifically on the scripting, Interactiveness, and a 3D
                                model for a minigame.
                                The Interactive comic follows a class learning about the death of their class hampster,
                                while the class asks the teacher very difficult questions about <b>death</b> and
                                <b>consiousness</b>.
                                We also added a perspective element, where if you hover over each character it changes
                                all the character's sprites in order to show how each student sees the world
                                differently.

                            While I enjoy programming and 3D modeling, I also enjoy level design the most out of
                            everything. I have worked on a few games and understanding
                            how to design interesting and unique levels that keep the player engaged is something I am
                            extremely interested in. Below are a few sketches of levels I have
                            created on my own or with a group in order to optimize the experience and introduce new
                            mechanics to the player. I will go more in depth on each of these levels and what I learned
                            from them below.

                                This is a game I worked on with three other students in my game design class. We worked
                                on laying this level out for almost an hour making minor tweaks and changes.
                                The game is a couch co-op 3D platformer where two players work together in order to
                                escape from the center of the earth. The mineshaft level shown is <b>really dark and
                                    hard to see the obstacles.</b> Each level the players get a new power and in this
                                one the players have a flashlight type power (player 1)
                                and rock break gauntlets (player 2). Each player's movement options are also slightly
                                different: one player moves slower and doesn't jump as high (player 1), while the other
                                player moves faster and jumps higher (player 2).
                                The players have to split up in order to get through the level. First, player 2 has to
                                jump to an area only they can get to in order to do some platforming and let player 1
                                access the next floor.<b> Player 1 has to shine its light up</b>
                                in order to light the environment for player 2 to see and break the obstacles in this
                                dark level. Once they both are on the same level, player 1 has to stay close to player 2
                                in order to light the way to the exit. This level was a lot of fun to make and I learned
                                a lot about how to make a level,
                                and how to split up characters naturally to make them have to interact in new ways.

                                This is the Molten level for the same <b>couch co-op game for the mineshaft</b>. We
                                worked on a few different levels, and in this level, the players have a lava sheild and
                                a push rock ability in order to help eachother complete the level. the player with the
                                lava sheild can <b>cross the lava and protect the other player</b>
                                while they push rocks. The player with the push rock ability can push rocks in order
                                to<b> make platforms for the players to jump on</b>. Like the level above it was a lot
                                of fun brainstorming ideas to make this level interesting.

                            these models and they all display something I have learned in Blender. One shows off
                            lighting, another low

                            <p> This is a knife model I worked on in my animation and 3D modeling class. In order to

                                I had to learn <b>Maya, RoadKill, and Substance Painter 3D</b>. I really enjoyed making

                                painting it in Substance Painter. I feel like it worked out really well in the end,
